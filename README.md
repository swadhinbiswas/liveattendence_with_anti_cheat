**Secure Face Login with Liveness Detection (Python & React)**

This repository implements a secure face login system using:

- **Face Detection:** Utilizes Python libraries like OpenCV or Dlib to detect faces in real-time video streams.
- **Anti-Spoofing:** Employs deep learning models trained on liveness detection datasets to distinguish real faces from spoofing attempts (photos, videos).
- **React Frontend:** Built with React for a user-friendly and interactive login experience.

This project offers:

- **Enhanced Security:** Prevents unauthorized access through photo or video spoofing.
- **Real-time Processing:** Performs face detection and liveness checks in real-time for seamless user interaction.
- **Open-Source Code:** Accessible on GitHub for learning, customization, and contributions.
